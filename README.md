# Antweight-Combat-Robots
This is a collection of CAD models of different plastic antweight combat robots designed by me in Autodesk Fusion. All three bots use a drum spinner as the main weapon and a brushless drive system. One bot uses 3 omni wheels 120 degrees apart from each other to achieve holonomic motion, and another has an additional horizontal spinner in the back for twice the damage.
